	<br>
        <p align="justify">
	<font size="3"> This paper examines the association between racial demographics and the shifting of cigarette 
	excise taxes to consumer prices. Using scanner data on cigarette sales from 1,687 stores across
	53 American cities, 2009 to 2011, we found that cigarette taxes are shifted significantly less to
	consumer prices in cities with large minority (black and Hispanic) populations. The potential for
	price search behavior implies that our estimates understate the magnitude of the true relationship
	between local racial composition and cigarette tax shifting. Our finding suggests that increasing
	cigarette taxes may not be an effective means of reducing cigarette consumption in high-minority areas.

        <a>Multiproduct Search and Retail Pricing: Some Empirical Results</a> (with Jungwon Yeo)
        <br>
        <p align="justify">
	<font size="3"> 
	The existence of fixed costs of shopping (or search) and consumers' tendency to shop for multiple
	products induces multiproduct retailers to price otherwise independent products with consideration for
	one another. Economic theory has provided insight into how multiproduct retailers price their products
	in such an environment. We herein document several features of multiproduct retailers' pricing behavior
	using supermarket scanner data. We develop a measure of product variety and find the e¤ect of a store's
	o¤ering of an additional product on the store's prices is positive when it adds to the brand variety and
	negative when it adds to the category variety, conforming to theories that purport to draw opposite
	conclusions. We also find that supermarkets cross-subsidize low prices of some products with high prices
	of other products.

        <a>Estimation of Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles</a> (with Hyungjin Kim)
        <br>
        <p align="justify">
	<font size="3"> 
	Antitrust authorities have questioned whether lock-in effects impede competition in telecommunications
	markets, and the answer to this question still remains unclear because few
	studies have attempted to quantify the switching costs in telecommunications bundles. We
	develop a consumer level demand model of telecommunication services which allows us to
	estimate switching costs of bundled products. In our application we use novel consumer level
	data and find that consumers experience substantial costs when they switch from bundled
	services. Our estimates indicate that consumers pay approximately $1.33 USD per month
	when change from double-play services (mobile), $6.75 USD per month for switching from
	double-play services (paid TV), and $4.33 USD per month when switching from triple-play
	services. Our counterfactual exercises show that the market share of cable TV operators
	would be 2.24% larger without imposing penalties for switching bundling, while adoption
	rate of bundling would less widely adopted by 4.45%. The exercises confirm our concern
	that bundled services can potentially lock in consumers.

        <a>The Dynamic Effects of Sales on Store Choices</a>
        <br>
        <p align="justify">
<font size="3"> 
A large literature shows workers who are involuntarily separated experience wage scars: their hourly earnings fall initially by an average of 15.4% and remain much lower than their 
non-separated counterparts more than 20 years later. We find that this reduces average life-cycle wage growth by 14.7% and increases cross-sectional wage dispersion by 17.8%. 
We research variants of human capital theory capable of replicating scars, highlighting a tension in producing large, persistent wage scars alongside average life-cycle wage dynamics.
An examination of labor market and demographic characteristics of workers who never recover suggests many theories of wage scars are operational, but on different groups of workers. </p>
